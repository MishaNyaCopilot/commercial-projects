# Freelance Projects Portfolio

This repository contains documentation for several freelance projects I developed.  
Source code for these projects cannot be published due to client confidentiality, but each folder includes a detailed overview of the system architecture, technologies used, implementation notes, and my specific contributions.

The goal of this repository is to provide transparent insight into my engineering experience across different domains, including:

- Telegram bots and automation tools  
- AI/LLM-driven assistants  
- Speech processing and transcription services  
- Monitoring and scraping systems  
- Structured data pipelines  
- Call-center analytics and reporting tools  

Each project folder includes:

- **Project description**  
- **Technical stack**  
- **Architecture overview**  
- **Key features and workflow**  
- **Engineering challenges and solutions**  
- **Outcome and delivered value**

This repository serves as an extended part of my professional portfolio and complements my public projects, which are available on GitHub and GitHub Pages.
